It's really quite simple.

1. R Studio IDE has all the window I want in one place: 
  - Easy versioning with git and GitHub
  - A list of files that I can easily open or manipulate
  - Consule for running code
  - Terminal for running commands
1. R Studio projects allow me to stay organized keep files and the environments in which I work together.
  - With as much multitasking as I do, it's nice to start right where I left off.
1. R Markdown allows me to output to a number of different formats, and changing formats doesn't require a ton of extra tedious work
1. I can also work with many different types of documents
  - Text files
  - Markdown
